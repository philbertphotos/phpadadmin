=Self Service Password GPO=

I have also had a dabble at creating a GPO for password change self service today, this was alot more simple than I had predicted.  Having created policies to secure Terminal/Citrix servers before, which can be a bit of a pain.


==Solution==


Create an OU for you self service user. Create your new user i have used called mine  password, and then set the password and make it simple i.e. password and set it to never expire.

Create a Policy opbject for the new OU (using group policy management console http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/gpmc/default.mspx) and modify the following

User Configuration
	Administrative Templates
		System
			Custom user interface -> Set this to "C:\program files\internet explorer\iexplorer.exe" -k http:\\path
		
			Run only allowed Windows Applications -> Add only iexplore.exe
		
			System/Ctrl+Alt+Del Options
				Remove Change Password -> enabled
				Remove Task Manager -> enabled
	
		Windows Components
			Internet Explorer
				Browser Menus
					Disable Context Menu -> enabled
					File menu: Disable closing the brwser and explorer windows -> enabled

With the above policy your self service password will be forced in to IE in Kiosk mode and the user can only browse the site you point it at.  

	Note: if site contains links that will navigate out of its own site this will still work
	
Users are can only log out by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del where they will only be presented with the options to log off or shutdown the machine.
