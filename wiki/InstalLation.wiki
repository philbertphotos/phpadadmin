=Installation=

==Step 1==

  * Download from http://www.php.net/downloads.php 
  * Unzip php directory to root of your C: drive 
  * from the PHP directory copy the php.ini-reccommended to C:\windows direcotry and rename it to php.ini 
  * Uncomment the windows include path under "Paths and Direcotries" ( Line 515 on current build ) 
    * So it reads
{{{
include_path = ".;c:\php\includes"
}}}
  * set cgi.force_redirect to 1 this is done by uncommenting the existing line ( Line 540 on current build ) 
    * So it reads: 
{{{
cgi.force_redirect = 1 
}}}
  * Enable the PHP Ldap module this is done by uncommenting the extension under the "Windows Extensions" ( Line 650 on current build) 
     * So it Reads: 
`extension=php_ldap.dll`
  * Add the PHP directory to the windows path 
    * right click My Computer on the server 
    * Click the Advanced tab 
    * Select PATH from the system variables section 
    * Click Edit and add: 
{{{
C:\php; 
}}}
note: this last point requires a server reboot which will be done in the next step.
